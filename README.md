# AtticCollection

This is a rails app that allows you to make collections, events, trade games, and buy & sell games.

##Concepts

The idea was initally created as a way to keep track of a video game collection and like all things
the scope quickly gre from there. This at its core should be about tracking collections of items:
Video Games, VG Platforms, Movies, TV Shows, Trading Cards, and anything we can think of. It should
also be an event co-ordination platform in which you can create events in which others can join, help
to administrate the event and be a public page for it. It should lastly be a marketplace in trading,
buying and selling of games. This will surely change and morph as we get a better understanding of
what we are actually trying to achieve.
